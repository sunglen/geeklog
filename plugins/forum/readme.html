<p class="sectionheading" style="margin-bottom:0px;"><a id="installation">1) How to Install</a></p>
<p class="attention" style="margin-top:5px;">You need to manually create the plugins program directories and copy the files to their appropriate directories.</p>
<p style="padding:20px;">If you are new to installing a geeklog plugin, I recommend that you review the background documentation on how to install a plugin <a href="http://wiki.geeklog.net/index.php/Plugins">here</a></p>
<p>Step 0 - Backup your Database</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a backup of your current 
geeklog database using the built-in admin feature. Verify your backup feature is 
configured correctly and backup file is not 0 bytes. <span class="attention">This is worth the time to verify your backup</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Step 1 - Restore the plugin Archive</p>
<ul>
<li>Uncompress the archive files into your &lt;geeklog_dir&gt;/plugins directory. It will create a forum subdirectory for the files.</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 2 - Create the required plugin directories</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a directory called <b>forum</b> under your public_html directory</li>
<li>Create a directory called <b>forum</b> under your public_html/admin/plugins directory</li>
</ul>


<p>Step 3 - Copy the the required plugin files</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy the files (contents) from the new plugin's public_html directory to the <b>forum</b> directory you just created under your sites main public_html directory</li>
<li>Copy the files (contents) from the new plugin's admin directory to the <b>forum</b> directory you just created under your sites main public_html/admin/plugins directory</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 4 - Copy the the required theme files</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy the directory called <b>forum</b> and contents from the new plugin's themefiles directory to your sites theme's directory. Assuming your site is running the <i>professional</i> theme this  would be <i>public_html/layout/professional</i>. You would then copy the themefiles/forum directry from the plugin archive so that you create a <i>professional/forum</i> directory with all the new layout files from the plugin archive</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 5 - Update or copy the lib-portalparts.php file</p>
<ul>
<li>The plugins from portalparts use a number of common functions that are placed in the lib-portalparts.php file. Copy the file from the plugin archive to your system folder where there are other lib-xxxxx.php files</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 6 - Run the plugin install</p>
<ul>
<li>Logged in as 'admin' you can access the installer from the plugin editor [<i>admin -&gt; plugins</i>]</li>
<li>If the files have been copied correctly in step 3 and 4, you will see the new plugin to be installed</li>
</ul>


<p>Step 7 - Update your themes css - <i>style.css</i> file</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>The forum is using the plugin CSS that is distributed with the GL 1.4.1 professional theme. If you are running a GL 1.4.1 site and using the stock professional theme or a 1.4.1 certified theme, you will only need to add a few new CSS styles <i>declarations</i> for the codeblock and quote formatting feature.</blockquote></li>
<li>If you have a GL 1.4 site or using a beta release of GL 1.4.1, then update style.css file using the <b>pre1.4.1_forum.css</b> file in the archive under the themefiles folder. Backup your current style.css file for reference and for many sites, they can just replace all the plugin like CSS declarations. They should all be grouped together in your style.css file.</li>
<li>Pre 1.4.1 themes will also need to add missing navbar images. Add the images found in archives themefiles/navbar/images folder to the same folder under your site's theme.<br>Add the CSS declarations from the <b>forum.css</b> file in the archive under the themefiles folder.<br><br></li>
<li>If you have a GL 1.4.1 final site, then you will only need to add the few additional CSS styles for the codeblock and quote formatting.<br>Add the CSS declarations from the <b>forum.css</b> file in the archive under the themefiles folder.<br></li>
</ul>

<p>Step 8 - Setup your forums and review Admin Settings</p>
<ul>
<li>Create atleast one category which will contain one or more forums</li>
<li>Create a forum within this category. A forum will then contain many topics which are created by your community of users. The forums are created and so named to organize your topics.</li>
<li>The forums can be setup to be restricted to site-members only or public access as well other options can be set to control the access to the forums</li>
<li>Review the optional plugin <a href="#_config">config.php settings</a></li>
</ul>

<p class="sectionheading" style="margin-bottom:0px;"><a id="update1">2) How to update from version 2.5RC3</a></p>
<p>Step 0 - Backup your Database.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a backup of your current geeklog database using the built-in admin feature. Verify your backup feature is 
configured correctly and backup file is not 0 bytes. <div class="attention">The backup is strongly recommended. The update will need to modify your database. Additionally, incase there are any formatting issues with your forum content after the update, you may want to have the option of going back</div></li>
</ul>

<p>Step 1 - Disable the forum plugin (optional)</p>
<p class="attention" style="margin-top:5px;padding-left:25px;">Note: A bug in GL 1.4.1 pre-release may create a SQL error when toggling the enable/disable of the plugin. If this occurs - skip this step and leave it enabled.</p>
<ul>
<li>From the Plugin Editor <b>Admin &gt; plugins</b>, disable the forum plugin so any current site users will not be accessing the forum during the update. This is an optional step and not required.</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 2 - Restore the plugin Archive</p>
<ul>
<li>Uncompress the archive files into your &lt;geeklog_dir&gt;/plugins directory. You will need to replace all the files and some directories and files are no longer needed.</li>
<li>Update all your sites main public_html/forum files. Suggest you delete current files and copy over the new files</li>
<li>Update all your sites main public_html/admin/plugins/forum files. Suggest you delete current files and copy over the new files</li>
<li>Update all your sites main public_html/layout/{theme}/forum files. Suggest you delete current files and copy over the new files</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 3 - Run the plugin update</p>
<p class="attention" style="margin-top:5px;padding-left:25px;">Note: If the forum was still enabled, the centerblock and sideblock will be disabled once you copy over the new code until you complete the plugin update</p>
<ul>
<li>Access the plugin update from the Plugin Editor. The plugin listing will show version 2.5RCx is installed and that an update is recommended. Using the Edit link by the plugin record, access the edit screen where there will now be an <b>update</b> button. Pressing [Update] will execute the needed database changes</li>
<li>Run the <b>Forum Re-Sync</b> admin feature to complete the update of the new forum fields. From the Admim-&gt;Forum screen, access the admin section for <i>forums</i>. You will see that you can Re-Sync each forum or all forums for a category.
<blockquote>This is a manual task because initial testing on large forums found that an automated update on a site with a large number of forums and possiby thousands of posts per forum could exceed the max-execution time allowed on your webserver</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>Step 4 - Update your theme and theme css - <i>style.css</i> file</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>The forum is using the plugin CSS that is distributed with the GL 1.4.1 professional theme. If you are running a GL 1.4.1 site and using the stock professional theme or a 1.4.1 certified theme, you will only need to add a few new CSS styles <i>declarations</i> for the codeblock and quote formatting feature.</blockquote></li>
<li>If you have a GL 1.4 site or using a beta release of GL 1.4.1, then update style.css file using the <b>pre1.4.1_forum.css</b> file in the archive under the themefiles folder. Backup your current style.css file for reference and for many sites, they can just replace all the plugin like CSS declarations. They should all be grouped together in your style.css file.</li>
<li>Pre 1.4.1 themes will also need to add missing navbar images. Add the images found in archives themefiles/navbar/images folder to the same folder under your site's theme.<br>Add the CSS declarations from the <b>forum.css</b> file in the archive under the themefiles folder.<br><br></li>
<li>If you have a GL 1.4.1 final site, then you will only need to add the few additional CSS styles for the codeblock and quote formatting.<br>Add the CSS declarations from the <b>forum.css</b> file in the archive under the themefiles folder.<br></li>
<li>The forum now is able to appear with leftblocks only (default), noblocks, rightblocks only or both left and right blocks. Setting to noblocks allows the forum to appear the full-width of your theme. Additionally, you can show the usermenu as a horizontal navbar which is necessary if you are not showing left or right blocks. These new settings are expected to be in your themes <i>functions.php</i> file so the layout can be theme specific. Refer to the default professional theme version of <i>functions.php</i> that is in the plugin archive themefiles directory for more details.</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 5 - Review Admin Settings</p>
<ul>
<li>Review the admin settings</li>
<li>Review the optional plugin <a href="#_config">config.php settings</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Congradulations - you should now have your forum updated to version 2.7</p>

<p>Step 2 - Restore the plugin Archive</p>
<p class="attention" style="margin-top:5px;padding-left:25px;">Note: Make a copy of your plugins config.php and compare to the new one if you have made changes. Additionally, do the same for your forum theme files if you have made changes that you don't want to loose.</p>
