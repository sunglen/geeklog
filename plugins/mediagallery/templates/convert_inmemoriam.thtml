<h1>{wizard} Import to Media Gallery Wizard</h1>
<form action="{form_action}" method="post">
Select which Albums you would like to import.<br>
<p>
Please keep in mind that it takes a lot of processing to import images, so only select
a few albums at a time, this will keep your server from timing out trying to convert
everything at one time.
<p>
Note: Sub Albums are not selectable, they will be converted with the parent category.
