Media Gallery WKZ Installation - v1.6.10

For HTML docs see:

admin/install_doc.html
public_html/docs/usage.html

SPECIAL NOTE: Because usage.html is described for Media Gallery v1.6,
it has the part which isn't correct. (Sorry)

Media Gallery follows the standard Geeklog plugins procedure, which has not
been well documented.  Below we will document two methods to install the Media
Gallery files, via FTP and via standard shell access to the server.

REQUIREMENTS

Media Gallery has the following requirements:

    - Geeklog v1.4.0 or higher
    - PHP v4.3.0 or higher
    - MySQL v3.23 or higher or Microsoft SQL Server 2000 or higher

FTP Installation

If you do not have shell access to your server and can only use an FTP client
to access your server, follow these instructions.

To install Media Gallery, or any Geeklog plugin, you will need to un-archive
the plugin on your local computer. The Media Gallery distribution will
automatically create all the proper directories when it is un-archived.

To un-archive a .gz file, you can use later copies of WinZIP or WinRAR.

   1. Create a temporary directory on your local hard drive to hold the
      Media Gallery files (let's use C:\tmp for our example).
   2. Open the mediagallery-wkz_1.6.10_1.4.0.tar.gz file with WinRAR.
   3. Select Extract All Files and point to the C:\tmp directory as the
      destination.

Now we should have a local copy of the Media Gallery Plugin in C:\tmp

The directory should look like this:

+tmp\
    + mediagallery\
                  + admin\
                  + docs\
                  + include\
                  + language\
                  + lib\
                  + public_html\
                  + sql\
                  + templates\
                  + tmp\
                  + uploads\
                  + functions.inc
                  +

Now that you have a copy on your local hard drive, it is time to FTP up to
your server.

Start your FTP program, I recommend FileZilla if you do not have a program
you use already.  FileZilla is free and supports many different operating
systems (Windows, Linux, etc.).

Connect to your web server with your FTP program.

Our first FTP will be the entire Media Gallery distribution to your server.
You will want to use the diagrams below to find the proper directory on your
server and move the entire c:\tmp\mediagallery\ directory to the
path-to-geeklog/plugins/ directory.

To find the path-to-geeklog you can look in your Geeklog config.php file and
see what directory is defined in the $_CONF['path'] line.

SPECIAL NOTE: For the initial FTP of the Media Gallery distribution, you will
want to actually drag the mediagallery folder from your local computer to the
plugins directory on your server.  The remaining FTP's below you will actually
drag the files, not the parent directory.

tmp\                path-to-geeklog/
   |                               |
   + mediagallery\--+              + backups/
                    |              + data/
                    |              + include/
                    |              + language/
                    |              + logs/
                    |              + pdfs/
                    +------------->+ plugins/
                                   + public_html/
                                   + sql/
                                   + system/
                                   + config.php

Next, you will need to make a sub-directory under the public_html directory
on your server called mediagallery. For most FTP programs you can create
directories by highlighting the parent directory, public_html in this case,
then right click the mouse, select New Folder and name it mediagallery.
This procedure may be a little different depending on which FTP program you
are using, check their documentation.

  path-to-geeklog/
                 |
                 + backups/
                 + data/
                 + include/
                 + language/
                 + logs/
                 + pdfs/
                 + plugins/
                 + public_html/
                              |
                              + mediagallery <--- Make this subdirectory
                 + sql/
                 + system/
                 + config.php

Next you will need to FTP all the files from the
c:\tmp\mediagallery\public_html\* directory to your server.
Here you will want to select all the files and sub-directories in
the public_html\ directory, not just the public_html\ folder.
Follow the diagram below:

tmp\                 path-to-geeklog/
   |                                |
   + mediagallery\                  + backups/
                 |                  + data/
                 + public_html/*-+  + include/
                                 |  + language/
                                 |  + logs/
                                 |  + pdfs/
                                 |  + plugins/
                                 |  + public_html/
                                 |               |
                                 +-------------->+ mediagallery/
                                    + sql/
                                    + system/
                                    + config.php

Next, you will need to make a sub-directory under the admin/plugins/
directory on your server called mediagallery.

path-to-geeklog/
               |
               + backups/
               + data/
               + include/
               + language/
               + logs/
               + pdfs/
               + plugins/
               + public_html/
               |       |
               |       + admin\
               |           |
               |           + plugins\
               |                  + mediagallery <--- Make this subdirectory
               + sql/
               + system/
               + config.php

Next you will need to FTP all the files from the c:\tmp\mediagallery\admin\*
directory to your server. Here you will want to select all the files and
sub-directories in the admin\ directory, not just the public_html\ folder.
Follow the map below:

tmp\            path-to-geeklog/
   |                           |
   + mediagallery\             + backups/
                 |             + data/
                 + admin/---+  + include/
                            |  + language/
                            |  + logs/
                            |  + pdfs/
                            |  + plugins/
                            |  + public_html/
                            |            + admin/
                            |                 + plugins/
                            +-----------------------> + mediagallery/
                               + sql/
                               + system/
                               + config.php

Congratulations!  You should now have all the files uploaded to your server
and you are ready to skin to the Online Installation step below.

Standard Shell Access Installation

   1. Backup your Geeklog database because the Media Gallery plugin adds
      tables. You can do this with the built in database backup facility in
      the Admin menu.

   2. Uncompress the Media Gallery plugin archive while in the
      path-to-geeklog/plugins directory. The archive will create a directory
      called mediagallery.

   3. In your public_html directory, create a directory called mediagallery.

   4. Under public_html/admin/plugins/ directory, create a directory
      called mediagallery.

   5. Change to your path-to-geeklog/plugins/mediagallery directory.

   6. Copy the files in the admin directory to the admin/plugins/mediagallery
      directory you created in step 4.

   7. Copy the files in the public_html directory to the
      public_html/mediagallery directory you created in step 3.

Online Installation

Now that you have the files loaded on your server, it is time to actually
perform the Media Gallery installation into Geeklog.

   1. Go to the plugin administration page. The Media Gallery plugin should
      show up with a link to install it. Click this link. The install page
      will tell you if it was successful or not. If not, examine the Geeklog
      error.log in path-to-geeklog/logs/ to see what the problem was. Fix the
      problem and re-install.

   2. The install page will offer you a link to the configuration page of
      Media Gallery. You should select this link and make the necessary
      changes  to Media Gallery configuration to suit your environment.

Setting Permissions

   The following directory permissions must be set 757 (or 777).

      private/plugins/mediagallery/tmp
      private/plugins/mediagallery/uploads
      public_html/mediagallery/mediaobjects/covers and the following directories
      public_html/mediagallery/mediaobjects/disp   and the following directories
      public_html/mediagallery/mediaobjects/orig   and the following directories
      public_html/mediagallery/mediaobjects/tn     and the following directories

Standard Upgrade Process

   1. BACK UP YOUR EXISTING ENVIRONMENT!

   2. SAVE YOUR TEMPLATES IF YOU HAVE MADE MODIFICATIONS! You will need to
      re-apply your customizations to the templates after the upgrade.

   3. Refer to the installation instructions for New Installations for
      detailed instructions on uploading the new Media Gallery distribution to
      your server.

      If you are prompted to overwrite existing files, be sure to answer Yes.

   4. Go to the Geeklog Plugins Menu (from the Geeklog Administrator's menu).

   5. Select mediagallery plugin.

   6. You should have an UPDATE button, select it.

   7. If all goes well, the upgrade should be complete. If there were errors,
      please review your logs/error.log and correct any issues and try the
      UPDATE again.

Post Upgrade Checks

    * Verify all Media Gallery configuration settings.  New in v1.4 is that
      all configuration options are now configured online, no longer in the
      config.php file.  Go into the Media Gallery Administration Screen and
      select System Options and verify all your settings are as you would like.

    * Verify that all your auto tags are correctly formatted.  Depending on
      your previous version of Media Gallery, there have been several changes
      to how auto tags are used.

    * If you are upgrading from a v0.8x or v0.9x of Media Gallery, you should
      rebuild all thumbnails.  Media Gallery has the ability to display larger
      (200x200 pixel) thumbnails, v0.8x and v0.9x created all thumbnails at
      150x150 px size.  See the Media Gallery Administration Screen for the
      Rebuild All Thumbnail option.
