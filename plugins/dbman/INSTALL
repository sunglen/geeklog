Features of Dbman plugin
------------------------

The Dbman plugin backups/restores database WITHOUT using mysqldump(.exe).  The
Dbman plugin is published under GPL license.

BEFORE INSTALL
--------------

#####  WARNING #####

This plugin is still at its BETA release stage, so I'm afraid it could have some
bugs.  Make a backup of your current geeklog database IN ADVANCE using the
built-in admin feature or phpMyAdmin.  Verify your backup feature is configured
correctly and backup file is not 0 byte (This is worth a check).
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

INSTALL
-------

In the following steps,
<geeklog_dir> is a directory where your system's config.php files resides,
<public_html> is a directory where your lib-common.php file resides.

Step 1:  Uncompress the Dbman plugin archive (dbman-x.y.z.tar.gz) while in the
<geeklog_dir>/plugins directory.  The archive will create a directory named
dbman in the plugins directory.

Step 2:  Create the admin directory.  Under your <public_html>/admin/plugins/
directory create a directory named 'dbman'.  Dbman doesn't need a
'<public_html>/dbman' directory.

Step 3:  Change to your <geeklog_dir>/plugins/dbman/admin directory.  Copy the
files in the directory to the <public_html>/admin/plugins/dbman/ directory your
created in step 2.

Step 4:  Log in to your Geeklog as a root user (admin) and install Dbman plugin
in the plugin editor.  The install page will tell you if the install was successful
or not.  If not, examine Geeklog system errorlog for possible problems.

The Dbman plugin should now be installed and functioning.  Clicking on the Dbman
Icon will take you to the admin page.

Step 5: Set up security.  On install only the root users have access to Dbman
administration and Viewing.  You can delegate control for either of these
functions through the user and group editors.

Step 6: (Optional)  Configure Dbman.  If you are using Geeklog-1.5 or newer,
you can do this through admin's Configuration menu.  Otherwise, You can modify
<geeklog-dir>/plugins/dbman/config.php.  By default, Dbman *** doesn't ***
backup tables created by GUS (Geeklog Usage Stats) plugin, becuase they could
be too large to backup.

UNINSTALL
---------

Step 1:  Log in to your Geeklog as a root user (admin).  Uninstall Dbman plugin
in the plugin editor.

Step 2:  Delete the two plugin directories created in the install process:
<geeklog-dir>/plugins/dbman/ and <public_html>/admin/plugins/dbman/

That's it.

REVISION HISTORY
----------------

ver 0.5.4 2010-07-04  Fixed a bug where 'TIMESTAMP' field was not processed as
                      a string value.

ver 0.5.3 2009-11-04  Fixed an error when you choose a language other than 
                      English or Japanese.

ver 0.5.2 2008-09-26  Upgraded to prevent include-files to be directly accessed
                      in some case-insensitive file systems (e.g. MS Windows).

ver 0.5.1 2008-09-14  Modified to work properly with PHP-4.x by not using
                      htmlentities() and html_entity_decode() functions.

ver 0.5.0 2008-07-26  Modified to work properly with Geeklog-1.5 (Dbman works
                      properly with Geeklog-1.4.x as well).

ver 0.4.6 2007-10-28  Fixed not to display Dbman icon in the CC panel for
                      non-Dbman-admin users.

ver 0.4.5 2007-04-05  Fixed a broken path in SQL console screen.  Thanks Tsuchi!

ver 0.4.4 2007-03-25  Fixed to save CRLF correctly.

ver 0.4.3 2006-08-06  Now you can download backupped files simply by clicking

                      and execute SQL.

ver 0.4.2 2006-07-03  Modified to use $_Dbman_CONF['backup_except'] in deciding
                      whether a table's contents should not be backupped.  By
                      default, Dbman *** doesn't *** backup tables created by
                      GUS (Geeklog Usage Stats) plugin.  If you'd like to change
                      this, edit $_DBMAN_CONF['backup_except'] in
                      <geeklog_dir>/plugins/dbman/config.php.

ver 0.4.1 2006-07=03  Modified to backup records in small chunks (default 100)
                      to avoid "MySQL Client Out of Memory" error.  Modfied
                      to enabled plugin_upgrade_Dbman() to work properly.

ver 0.3.1 2006-04-28  Modified to save NULL values correctly.

ver 0.3               Initial version.
