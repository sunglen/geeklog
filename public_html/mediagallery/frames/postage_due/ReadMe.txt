put this directory in your modules/imageframe/frames directory.
you'll need the 'Imageframe' module to be installed and active.
to enable this frame, click on 'Edit Album', then on the 'Theme' tab. the 
options for frames are near the bottom.

after that, you can delete this file. or print it out and put it in a 
fancy frame. either way is fine by me.

if you have no idea what i'm talking about, you're probably looking for 
the 1.x version. those are still available here:
http://www.demonhood.com/addon/

enjoy.
